# AI-Assisted Nasal Drug Delivery Optimization

This project demonstrates how AI can support product decision-making in regulated healthcare environments.  
It combines experimental formulation data with AI-assisted reasoning and lightweight predictive modeling to guide formulation selection for nose-to-brain drug delivery.

## 🔍 Problem
Oral antiretroviral therapies show limited CNS penetration due to the blood–brain barrier, leading to persistent HIV reservoirs in the brain.  
This project explores a non-invasive nasal in-situ gel delivery system supported by AI-driven formulation evaluation.
