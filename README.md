## What this is
This project demonstrates how AI can support product decision-making in healthcare.
It uses an AI assistant (Claude) to evaluate nasal drug formulations, explain trade-offs,
and recommend an optimized formulation for nose-to-brain drug delivery.

## Problem
Oral antiretroviral therapies struggle to cross the blood–brain barrier, leading to
persistent HIV reservoirs in the brain. A non-invasive nasal delivery system can
bypass this barrier and improve treatment outcomes.

## AI Product Thinking
- AI-assisted evaluation of formulation trade-offs
- Human-in-the-loop decision making
- Safety and performance constraints
- Metrics-driven optimization

---

## Why this matters
- Improves patient adherence
- Reduces R&D iteration time
- Demonstrates AI as a decision-support tool, not a black box
